# R for Data Science


This repository contains course notes, data, and slides for the R for Data Science
course taught by CoRise. 

## Getting Started

### Install the `gitpod` extension

The easiest way to get started is by installing the [gitpod browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension). Once you add this extension, you will see a green colored gitpod button in every GitHub repository that has integrated with gitpod.

### Fork this repository to your GitHub account

The next step is to fork this repository to your GitHub account. Doing this will let you work with your own copy of the data and documents and allow you to make and save changes.

### Click on the green colored gitpod button

This will take you to `gitpod`. You might be prompted to sign in to `gitpod` if you have not already done so. I would recommend using the `github` sign in as it would make it a lot easier for you to save your changes back to `github`.

The first time you open a GitHub repository in `gitpod`, it will prompt you to start a new workspace. You can accept the defaults as-is and click on the continue button.

Gitpod will create a workspace for your GitHub repository and open it in your browser. If all goes well, you will be greeted with this screen.

Gitpod natively opens the VS Code IDE. However, we will be using RStudio for this course.

I would recommend clicking on the Open Browser icon on the top right to open RStudio in a new browser tab.

You can log in with the username `gitpod` and password `gitpod`.
